<b>Transforming the way waste is disposed and recycled.</b><br>
</p>

Our sole mission is to transform, eradicate and recycle unwanted and unusable materials.

Some of our core beliefs are:
* Revolutionize the way people interact with waste
* Design for the past, the present and the future
* To create a safe space for free exchange of ideas
* People are infinitely diverse, our products should too
* Everything can be improved and customized
* To create a community where everyone can contribute irrespective of any factor

# How do I join?

The community is open to everyone with a demonstrated interest in collaborating on best practices. We’re starting with a small, but growing, group of contributors to ensure a good experience. If you’d like to join, let us know, and we’ll review it as we add more members.

One possible way is to tell us through an issue [here](https://github.com/Recyclero/Recyclero/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=join-recyclero.md&title=I+would+love+to+join+Recyclero). You may, also, email us or get in touch at Slack. The list is limited upon your imagination. :rocket:

**Hint:** _Contributing to one of our on-going projects is the best way to express your interest_.

# Contact

One can get in touch with us by opening an issue or sending us an [email](mailto:hello@recyclero.com).

# Guidelines

The only restriction we impose is that your action or words must not hurt others. We do realize that sometimes one may get hurt unintentionally. It is important to realize that we are **one big family** and at the end of the day, our purpose boils down to making our Earth :earth_americas: a better place.

We are working on a lot of stuff and we will help you to find an appropriate place in one or some of them. You can start working on your idea as well under our initiative and other members will join and help you. Best of luck in improving the world.

## We are looking forward towards enjoying with you. :wine_glass: :cake: :dancer: 

> We can do it and we will do it.
